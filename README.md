# Music Player

This Music Player Web App focuses on adding a special, static (which can be dynamic) audio-audio feature in music players.
The sole purpose of this Music Player project was not to showcase the building of a Music Player/Clone like Spotify or Deezer,
but to showcase how static feature might be a usefull addition to spotify's 'search to play a song' functionality

## Technologies used
1. **Vue 3**
2. **Tailwind CSS**

## How it works
The 'Play Song' button on the navbar allows you to play a particular song of a specific artist in the library, without the need to go to the 'search page' like spotify/deezer does.

**With Spotify**
[![SPOTIFY PAGE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanatII1/Music-Player/main/spotify-clone/public/images/docs/Spotify-Search.png)](https://open.spotify.com/search/)

**With Music Player**

**To play the songs in the library**
1. Click the Play Song Button
2. Click 'Allow' to allow the browser to play the songs in the 'My Library'
3. Command to play the song is as follows: 'music play (music name) by (artist)'

**NOTE: ONLY ARIANA GRANDE IS AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. More dynamism will be added and more artists and songs will be available**
